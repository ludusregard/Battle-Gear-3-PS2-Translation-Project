This texture pack translates the entirety of the offline portions of Battle Gear 3 for PS2 to English (US). This is a texture pack to be used in PCSX2 with one of the non-software rendering options. Simply unzip and place "SLPM-65434" into your PCSX2 textures folder. Make sure to properly enable PCSX2's Texture Replacement feature like the image below:

### NOTES
- If you are running into slowdown while playing the game, try turning down "Blending Accuracy" in the "Rending" options.

- To play the Main Race mode, you need to register a user with an entry ID and password. This came printed on the manual of the game originally. You can use **ID: 75245226** and **Password: DAE24APC** to successfully register a user and play the Main Race.

- By default BG3 has analog stick throttle/braking available so I recommend remapping triggers on modern controllers with PCSX2.

- This release only translates what I could dump of the offline portions of the game so it is an incomplete translation if someone ever gets network features working for this title.

- The only known untranslated text is of the track titles at the beginning of battles in Main Race. If you find any other leftover untranslated bits please let me know!

- For anyone wanting to make their own translation please feel free to use anything here. The primary typefaces I used were Helvetica Neue Bold, Helvetica Neue Regular, and Helvetica LT UltraCompressed. The game's original English text was definitely based off Helvetica so I recommend staying within that family to keep stylistic consistency.

- This translation texture pack is made to match original res, feel free to make your own HD UI using this as a base.

### STRETCH GOALS/ADDITIONAL FUTURE WORK
- Dump/translate the remaining text related to network online mode.

- Look into making a better deinterlace patch (current one bundled with PCSX2 disables attract mode and prevents Main Race track preview images from rendering).

- xDelta patch variant so the patch can run in Software Renderer/PS2 Hardware.

- Look into the possibillity of porting the extra content exclusive to Battle Gear 3 Tuned (final version of the arcade cabs came with an extra track and new cars like the 350z).
